This project is designed to create feasable methods for cahracterizing a plasma using IV curves. 
These characteristics include: the floating potential, the plasma potential, the ion saturation and electron saturation currents, the electron temperature, and the electron density. 
The IV data needs to be saved as a ".csv" file
